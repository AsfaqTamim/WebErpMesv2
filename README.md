# WEB ERP MES
##  Ressource and Manufacturing execution system  Web

WEM is a business management web application using Laravel 8 and bootstrap 4.6.

#why MES?

Often, management systems offer full CRM and billing management. But if a link is missing between what is quoted and what must be manufactured.

MES offers a link between what the customer expects and a real-time status of the order in the manufacturing workshop.

This project is the continuation of https://github.com/billyboy35/WEB_MES but using a framework and the design https://github.com/jeroennoten/
Laravel-AdminLTE

I am unprofessional, any improvement discussion would be helpful (Help search for gantt planning creation).
