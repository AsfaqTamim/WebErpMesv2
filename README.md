# WEB ERP MES
##  Web Ressource and Manufacturing execution system  


# Why WEM ? :monocle_face:

Often, management systems offer full CRM and billing management. But if a link is missing between what is quoted and what must be manufactured.

MES offers a link between what the customer expects and a real-time status of the order in the manufacturing workshop.

This project using Laravel 8, Livewire and bootstrap 4.6.
